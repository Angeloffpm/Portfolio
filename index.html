		<p class = "infop"> Hello, I'm Pierce Angeloff and this is my portfolio. I'm a Freshman attending Mountain Vista High School. I have positioned this box to have equal margin from the top bar and the left edge of the screen. As you have probably noticed, floating to the right, is a picture of Rick Harrison, as he is a very photogenic person and a had perfect images to help me demonstrate my skills. Below, I have placed pictures to represent my forms of social media. I used align-self to align the images at the bottom of this div, and a combination of relative position and padding to space them.</p>

		<p class = "infop">In this block, I have made a few examples of hovering, colors, and fonts. This paragraph uses the font: Chelsea Market. To the right is a picture of Harambe, the most legendary gorilla to ever walk the earth. Hovering your cursor over the picture will zoom in slightly on the picture. <span class = "span1">This text is purple because purple is cool.</span></p>
